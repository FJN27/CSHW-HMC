Are we actually in a simulation? Yes? No? Maybe...? Why do you think so (or not)?
If we were, in fact, in a simulation, would that change your view of our world? How (or not)?

We might be living in a simulation, and the answer largely depends on how we define the “simulation.” The article reminds me of the “farmer and shooter hypothesis” in The Three-Body, a science fiction by Cixin Liu. The shooter hypothesis proposes that a hunter at a target creates a hole every ten centuries. Intellectual beings living in the spot will offer a law (a scientific principle in their world): there is a hole every ten centimeters. 

Suppose the simulation is defined in this way. In that case, we live in a simulation because the knowledge interpretation depends on our intellectual capacity. There should be no doubt that the fundamental laws of physics will be interpreted differently by higher dimensional beings. 

Even if we live in a simulation, it will not change my view significantly because all those scientific principles we discovered still function in our world, and it is hard to understand knowledge beyond our reconviction. For instance, two-dimensional beings can hardly understand three-dimensional spaces even if they are aware of the knowledge but without any empirical experiences.
