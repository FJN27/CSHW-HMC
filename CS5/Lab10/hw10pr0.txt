What is authorship?

Authorship refers to creating or producing a written work, such as a book, article, or poem. It is the process of being recognized as the owner of the object/work. To an extent, I agree with the court's result of rejecting the authorship because the person does not create the painting, but codes and many other algorithms might have the same capacity to do this. That being said, the creator should only have authorship to the code he creates, not the painting. In the article(novel), the journalist should not have the authorship since the work is not original. Many plots and writings created by artificial intelligence are taken from their databases and information from the internet, so the work only takes other people's ideas instead of its own inspiration.
