Which contributing factor within the bug's origins (there are many!) strikes you as the "most preventable" and why? Of course, this will be in hindsight….
The “most preventable” factor contributing to the error is the assumption that the Ariane 5’ velocity figure would not be large enough to cause the mistakes when converting it from 64 to 16 bits. I think it is preventable because airplane 5 was an elevated version of airplane four and had a greater velocity/speed, so the figure is expected to be more complex. In addition, the paper has not mentioned any pre-trials to support the assumption, except for statistical data from previous versions, which lacks reference significance. 

The investigative report that uncovered the bug stated that software "does not fail in the same sense as a mechanical system." Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Explain briefly.
I agree with the statement that uncovered the bug, stating that software "does not fail in the same sense as a mechanical system." When talking about a mechanical system, it refers to physical components (such as crews or circuits) constituting an object. When talking about the software, it is the control and logical flow operating all mechanical parts. If comparing the airplane to a living organism, mechanical systems will be the appearance, and software will be the internal
