The net effect of the gain in computer skill is thus, ironically, a gain in human skill. Humans—at least the best ones—are getting better at playing chess. Reflect on other areas—in the past or in the future—in which you imagine computers have made or will make humans better at something that has traditionally been a characteristically human strength.

One area computer has improved is writing. While writing has traditionally been considered a human strength by creativities and inspirations taken from personal experiences (something AI does not have), platforms, such as Grammarly, have helped improve language accuracy, coherence, and concision. Online platforms check grammar and spelling, improving expressions by avoiding ambiguities and repetitions. They also provide suggestions to make writing more compelling based on its genre and target audiences, such as an email to a friend or a literature analysis evaluated by an expert. Though AI cannot fully replace human creativity, using these online platforms helps writers to check and improve their writing and points out potential improvements, strengthening human skills.
